    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to build a movie recommendation system that will recommend movies to users based on their preferences. We will use the ratings given by the users to the movies to build a [collaborative filtering](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/collaborative/basics?hl=en) model. We will also use the information about the movies to build a [content-based](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/content-based/basics?hl=en) filtering model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collaborative Filtering- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to be able to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. We will also try to find out which movies are similar to each other and which movies are similar to a given movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "We may use the following methods to build our recommendation system:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression for classification of the movies, whether the user is interested or not based on the movie's metadata.\n",
    "- [SVD](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/matrix_factorization.html#surprise.prediction_algorithms.matrix_factorization.SVD) algorithm for collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content Base Filtering\n",
    "  - [TF-IDF](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) Vectorizer for extracting features from the movie's metadata. We will use summary of the movie as the input to the vectorizer. So we will find relative frequency of a word in a document and is given as (term instances/total instances). We will use the cosine similarity to find the similarity between the movies.\n",
    "  - Also we will use CountVectorizer instead of TF-IDF because we don't want to find the relative frequency of the words in the document. We will merge the keywords, cast, crew and genres to form a single string and use it as the input to the CountVectorizer.\n",
    "  - For both cases we will use the [cosine similarity](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html) to find the similarity between the movies.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "  - We will use the users ratings to recommend movies to another user based on his/her previous ratings. However there are many approaches to build that model. We are not sure which one is suitable for our hypotesis. We're currently researching on that.\n",
    "  \n",
