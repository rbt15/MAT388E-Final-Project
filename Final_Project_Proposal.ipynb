    "* [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)\n",
    "* [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)\n",

    "- movies_metadata.csv: The main Movies Metadata file. Contains information on 45,000 movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset. Features include posters, backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, languages, production countries and companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- keywords.csv: Contains the movie plot keywords for our MovieLens movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- credits.csv: Consists of Cast and Crew Information for all our movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- links.csv: The file that contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of all the movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- links_small.csv: Contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of a small subset of 9,000 movies of the Full Dataset.\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to build a movie recommendation system that will recommend movies to users based on their preferences. We will use the ratings given by the users to the movies to build a [collaborative filtering](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/collaborative/basics?hl=en) model. We will also use the information about the movies to build a [content-based](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/content-based/basics?hl=en) filtering model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to be able to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. We will also try to find out which movies are similar to each other and which movies are similar to a given movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "We may use the following methods to build our recommendation system:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression for classification of the movies, whether the user is interested or not based on the movie's metadata.\n",
    "- [SVD](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/matrix_factorization.html#surprise.prediction_algorithms.matrix_factorization.SVD) algorithm for collaborative filtering.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Report: we will write the report together.\n",

    "We will work on the essential parts of the project together. But we will also work on the parts that we are more interested in separately. Kıraç Acar Apaydın will work on the content-based filtering part and Berkkan Bütün will work on the collaborative filtering part."
